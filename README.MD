This application reads the journal files to track which materials you have and make it instantly visible. It shows which
materials are relevant to collect, how much you need to collect to upgrade a weapon or suit, unlock an engineer or craft
a blueprint. You can design loadouts and see the effects of the upgrades you want to apply. You can track your open
orders and stock on your fleetcarrier.
You can also export your wishlist from EDSY into the app, as well as easily share your wishlists and loadouts with other
commanders. A special feature of the app is an overlay that instantly shows you the relevance of data while standing at
the data terminal.

Below the official complete guide for this app, covering all the topics like downloading and installing, configuration,
usage
and hidden features.

A special thanks to CMDR Logan Terrick for creating this video!
