"blueprint.tips.engineer_b2","The easiest way to collect Settlement Defense Plans is to go to a POI as part of a mission and not complete the mission objective, so the POI can be reset with a relog. You can take Odyssey missions to POIs with a dataport, or a Horizons mission to a POI with 2 dataports. The Horizons POI is called ’Minor Wreckage’ (no threat) and you can get it from Horizons missions called ’Liberate Bootleg Liqour’, ’Surface recovery of something during Civil War’, ’Surface retrieval of something during expansion’ or ’Wartime surface recovery of something’. It may take some time to find the correct location and when you do, the spawn chance may be around 1 in 4 relogs.","The easiest way to collect Settlement Defense Plans is to go to a POI as part of a mission and not complete the mission objective, so the POI can be reset with a relog.
