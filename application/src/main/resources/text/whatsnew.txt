UI rework

- The Ship Editor still needs some work, but it is on the list
- There may still be some styling and layout issues, feel free to report anything you notice or think is wrong.

Other notable changes:
Loadout tab now shows options for modules to set the module as equipped or unequipped(previously double click)
