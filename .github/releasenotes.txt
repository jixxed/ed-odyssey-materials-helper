**What file should you download?**
If you are on Windows, you can install the auto updater msi file
If you are on Linux, you can install the auto updater deb or rpm file. If you are on an unsupported linux distro, you can download the portable autoupdater zip file.

The auto updaters will check for a new version on launch.
The portable zip versions are used as update packages. You can run them standalone, but they are no longer truly portable as settings are stored on the local machine.

**Release notes for this version:**
Added new Cargo slot type
Add Panther Clipper Mk II (Some stats still missing until released)
Add Mk II Cargo Racks
Update current ship in Ship Editor on EngineerCraft, ModuleBuy, ModuleRetrieve, ModuleSell, ModuleStore events
- Note that some events miss engineering data, so the current ship will always be accurate
- Leaving the outfitting screen will trigger a Loadout event and that will contain all engineering data
