**What file should you download?**
If you are on Windows, you can install the auto updater msi file
If you are on Linux, you can install the auto updater deb or rpm file. If you are on an unsupported linux distro, you can download the portable autoupdater zip file.

The auto updaters will check for a new version on launch.
The portable zip versions are used as update packages. You can run them standalone, but they are no longer truly portable as settings are stored on the local machine.

**Release notes for this version:**
Ship editor redesign
- Editor not scales with the application size, allowing it to be used on lower resolutions
- Reworked styling, so the UI is now colorblind friendly with the respective colorblind theme
- Added validation that reports on invalid ship configurations, for example equipping 2 shield generators
- New stats for acceleration (all ships)
- New stats for ship details (all ships)
- New supercruise profile stats for the FSD (newer ships only for now)
- Removed passengers from cargo config, passengers do not affect mass
- Power bars now are a fixed size, so 20%, 40% and 50% lines will stay in place even when overpowered
Updated pricing and mass for Panther Clipper Mk II Armour and Mk II Cargo racks
Updated Panther Clipper Mk II stats, thermals and image remaining
Added ability to add anti-corrosion cargo racks to Cargo slots
Added limitation to elevated privileges check to only run on UAC enabled systems. Disabling UAC severely compromises the security of the system and is not recommended, but some users have chosen to do so.
