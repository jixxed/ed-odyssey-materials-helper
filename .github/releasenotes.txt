**What file should you download?**
If you are on Windows, you can install the auto updater msi file
If you are on Linux, you can install the auto updater deb or rpm file. If you are on an unsupported linux distro, you can download the portable autoupdater zip file.

The auto updaters will check for a new version on launch.
The portable zip versions are used as update packages. You can run them standalone, but they are no longer truly portable as settings are stored on the local machine.

**Release notes for this version:**
Added colonisation project location
Renamed Meteope to Metope for Industrial layout
Updated the CG icon to match the CG icon in game
Fixed an issue that caused the progress bar and value to be out of sync for colonisation material entries in some cases
